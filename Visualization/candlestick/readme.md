I'm using candlestick chart to visualize the stock price of GME. 
GME is a famous stock among the redditors which was short squeezed 
during the 2020 and Covid time. It's market is volatile and is still
goes up and down in price frequently. Retail investors made about $35M
while the GME was one of the famous and most traded stock in robinhood 
but in the mean time hedge funds lost billions as GME was their shorted 
stock.
